Lecture schedule and corresponding materials are at http://data8.org/fa16/.

Homework, labs, and projects were designed within Jupyter Notebook. To open an
assignment (after Jupyter Notebook is installed), navigate to the directory via
the command prompt. Type <code>jupyter notebook</code>, which will open a tab
in your web browser. Click on <code> filename.ipynb </code>, which will open
another tab with that content. Code can be executed within a cell by moving the
cursor to that cell, then clicking on the play icon at the top.

If you do not have Jupyter notebook, you can implement everything within a Python IDE.
A pdf file has been created for each assignment. In the <code> hw </code> and
<code> lab </code> directories, there is a pdf of each assignment contained both
within each corresponding folder (e.g. <code> lab01 </code> and within the
<code> pdfs </code> directory.
